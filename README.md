# Mine Sweeper Kata

The exercise involves developing a Mine Sweeper game strictly adhering to the TDD, ATDD rules.
Mine Sweeper - Game Rules:
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you step on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to clear all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clearing a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. If you guess a square contains a bomb mark it with a flag.
A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges. If you clear a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open; recursively.
The first square you open could be a bomb.
You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.

UAT Scenarios:

```
1 – Game Board Creation phase:
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] Game created
```

```
2 – Game Over - Step on a bomb on 1;1
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
| |X| |
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] BOOM! – Game Over.
```

```
3 – Clean square 2;2 and get the number of bombs around
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
|3| | |
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] 3 bombs around your square.
```

```
4 – Mark the bombs around – What I expect after I marked the 3 squares as bombs [1;0 + 1;1 + 0;1].
+-+-+-+
| | | |
+-+-+-+
|*|*| |
+-+-+-+
|3|*| |
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] Square flagged as bomb.
```

```
5 – Game Victory – After I cleared the all the squares [2;0 + 2;1 + 2;2 + 1;2 + 1;2]
+-+-+-+
|2|2|1|
+-+-+-+
|*|*|2|
+-+-+-+
|3|*|2|
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] the land is cleared! GOOD JOB!
```

```
6 – Massive cleaning and victory clicking on 0;0
+-+-+-+
|_|1| |
+-+-+-+
|_|1|1|
+-+-+-+
|_|_|_|
+-+-+-+
[Sandbox 3x3] the land is cleared! GOOD JOB!
```

Kata Objective:
The game runs in BOT mode to print on the screen all the moves until we got a victory or game over. The test suite can simulate the game without having an executable. In that case the test suite will print on console the scenario; or in a log file with a clean test report [red/green style].
